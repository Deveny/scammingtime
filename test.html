      After cars come dogs in the alphabet. The dog alphabet is quite similar to ours. It goes as follows: 'A' for awe, 'B' for barking, 'C' for chain, 'D' for digging, 'O' for orientation, 'G' for game, 'H' for hole, 'J' for Jack, 'K' for kin, 'L' for lavender, 'M' for master, 'N' for no, 'P' for polygamy, 'Q' for quad, ‘R’ for race, ‘S’ for soil, 'T' for tooth,  ‘U’ for uphill, ‘V’ for vault, 'W' for wound. In addition to these common Latin letters, three Greek letters are part of the dog alphabet too. 'X' for chroma, 'Ψ' for the exclamation to catch one's attention, psst,  'Ω' as a phonetic symbol for a dogs howl.

Counting 25 characters, 'I' is missing in this alphabet of a dog. As our dog friend is almost never aware of itself returning a look, yet it perceives our gaze as familiar. Many have wondered whether this is the reason dogs don't name themselves. The concept of the self is lacking this much that the constitution of dogs have decided to remove the letter 'I' to devote themselves truly to mankind. 

"The animal comes from over the horizon." Still it uses the same constructions as we do. </div>
