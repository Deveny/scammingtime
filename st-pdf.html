my face glowed for 3 days after having made cross-mutation with this forest
and wet keeping me up and wet looking forward to be-
i was tanned by the richest of energies, humidity.
ing with you, again, too, keeping me looking so much
you remember everything i said
forward to meet your wetness, first with my hand and
are you just, very smart?
hear you gasp while our gazes are locked in a ful-
yes it is an avocado plant, why is the world so ob- sessed this this fresh fat non greasy delicious balls?

my bulb going on
already feel your throat held by my hand i'm looking
with war and fog and sure
forward to feel your throat, held by my hand. i'll push
i can take it out
deep into your breath and slowly let go while i rub my
whatever you want
pussy on yours, moistening mine - so fleshy so thick so
but can we continue over that pink paper you put on my mac
wet and it keeps on: so hot so horny so turned on so
pose posing everytime press the shutter

overflowed with pleasure desire pleasure desire plea-
is it, elegant? i found out it works both ways,
sure desire pleasure desire - i'm looking forward - it's keeping me up and wet and writing and sighing and crushed out so crushed getting interrupted on a daily basis with all the sexy second wave, the secondary ef- fects of fucking you.
 something along the lines of thrust and slap and spit and lick and more no slower now harder and moan or gasp and sigh and again (and again) - you know... ?
there is not so much, you baked a pumpkin like you do in the restaurant, are you slowly appropriating new
a man-made warmth for the lacking of sun
skills and reinventing them in a happy greasy-free world? are these the only things you're taking from this
oh, and, also bite and pinch press and caress whis-
sun-held cubicle? a sliding hand at the shop, a handful of lube, we are all that we buy, or maybe that we wish

per lick and sniff and squeeze squeeze deep hug hold
 to be. patchouli, lemongrass, 3 boxes of lube, 2 babies coming down to earth. soil me down. down, like i wrote
- fuck the cold! your breathe your breathe the sound
earlier is where it is all going so what's up with the air phase? i'm usually on the bike but before
of pounding steps a runner on concrete: is that you?
i was on the sole ground aimlessly walking (no hu- mens around) patchouli reminds me of wetness.

i'm forced to ask questions in this room where we're all forcibly cumming or rather fucking our writing devices.
shaky pins and needles but i want more - does this feel
plans for tomorrow? i don't know, i'm sure needing to scam time. time time time time time time time lost
good? i'm looking for it - i'm looking and looking and
lost lost lost lost list all the things do all the time three times four times for time and then what? you go some-
it does feel good i can't wait to see you to touch you
where or rather loose track, this bench is so wobbly ly me and you and all the other ones around, this is a
touching me too to have that uncertain moment pre-
mess a mild easy sensation - sensational! are we... all going to read? is this really a way of writing, the task
vious to finding out how my body can excite yours, to-
to turn your thoughts, your voice, to words? they tell me 'you have a lot of silky flowery shirts', hand on my
day, can't wait cat can't no oh and hmm how you com-
chest or somewhere on my torso, i enjoy that – for so long there was a touch, euphoria, and for now every-
municate desire so clearly so simply open there bare
one seems to be rather distant, you always have to mediate your touch, your words and afterall it wouldn't
stare into each other's doubt of whether the other can
matter because you're doing a monologue. i wonder why do i sustain this whatsapp messaging, should
read their minds - i generally have thoughts of my own,
i say it's enough? that i want something else? we're playing your game, around you and your dens, multiple
the kind you can't yet share, and the certainty of be-
dens or none at all, you seem to be eternally missing something like a confirmation of reality as it is, hey!
ing perfectly unable to tell what's on your mind - and
it is like this but hey you get to change it :) you are an active member of this world, you make up its surface,
i come and you come and how come how can i make
its cracks and protuberances, it's not possible to do it alone, we are too tied up, to each other and another
sure no need fuck me please you fuck me with your
and the other. free writing free range like the chickens at the shop, ok this is dark but somehow today i'd like

words you're already fucking me giving it to me fuck
 you for your dark and humid energies, for your devo- tion to the spirit for your raging destruction to every-
exactly what i want and want what i can't yet know nor
thing you don't believe in.
you but yes it's hot like this ask me what i want and i'll
did you know i think about you? that tonight i'm dress- ing rocket in a fresh and hot
stop and start over, events mark the writ- ing.
try to be precise if my mouth and breath will be avail-
able to speak - i'll let you know soon if that's ok. your kindness is very sexy, i am sexy and surprise i'm all these other things running through your unreadable mind that somehow amount once more to me being very very sexy the dampness grows in between your legs and your face lit up with desire teasing me into you magnetically pulling me distractedly looking at books you find yourself in there and we play a differ- ent kind of play a new play but we do - i'm glad we're extending the lexicon and it grows and grows it's roots, aerial ones that twist and turn
